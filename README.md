# Training Diary

An open-sourced self-hosted web-based training diary.

Having your workout data spread out over multiple devices and cloud providers?
Tired of services shutting down and you having to migrate your data to a new
provider? Take control of your own workout data and keep a safe personal backup.
This project will allow you to easily import all your current data and don't
depend on external hosted services.

** PROTOTYPE IN PROGRESS, NOT READY FOR GENERAL USE **

    routes, suggest activity type and name
